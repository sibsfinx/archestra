"""Verify the agent authored an app that wires the DeepWiki (3rd-party MCP) integration.

Reads BENCH_STATE: `rest` holds the `/api/apps?search=...` snapshot captured after the run, and
`tool_calls` holds the run's ordered tool invocations. `/api/apps` returns a discriminated union --
keep `source == "owned"` rows. Wiring is proven from the `scaffold_app` call's `tools` arg: a tool
name only resolves (and the app only gets created) if it exists in the org environment, so a wired
`deepwiki__*` name is a real signal, not a memorizable proxy.
