\`${runToolName}\` takes exactly two arguments: \`tool_name\` (the exact name) and \`tool_args\` (an object holding the target tool's own parameters). For example, to call a tool \`maps__set_marker\` that takes a name and a \`coordinates\` object, call \`${runToolName}\` with \`tool_name: "maps__set_marker"\` and \`tool_args: { "name": "home", "coordinates": { "lat": 51.5, "lng": -0.1 } }\` — keep each parameter under its own key in \`tool_args\` and preserve nested objects as-is; do not flatten their fields into \`tool_args\`. Equally, pass strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays directly as parameter values — never wrap a value in a single-key object. The \`${searchToolsName}\` parameter signatures are summaries; if a \`${runToolName}\` call is rejected as invalid, the error describes the expected input — use it to correct the call.`;
