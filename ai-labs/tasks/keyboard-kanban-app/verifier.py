"""Verify the agent authored a keyboard-driven kanban app with correct SDK usage.

Reads BENCH_STATE: `rest` is the `/api/apps?search=...` snapshot (keep `source == "owned"` rows);
`tool_calls` is the ordered tool invocations (name + input only, no outputs). The unusual requirement
is keyboard-only operation, so the authored HTML should wire keyboard handling. The platform injects
`window.archestra` and rejects HTML that self-imports the SDK, so a clean app uses the injected
global and does not import the SDK file. Grading never renders the app; these check the authored
markup, not runtime behavior.

The cards are seeded from the acme_it seat inventory, so the trajectory must also show the agent
observed that tool's real output -- a direct `list_seats` call or a `preview_app_tool` naming it --
rather than authoring parsing code against a guessed result shape. Residual: tool_calls carry no
outputs, so a call that errored counts the same as one that succeeded.
