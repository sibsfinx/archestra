//! # baton-core
//!
//! A prototype information-flow policy engine for LLM agent trajectories, in
//! the language-based IFC tradition (Sabelfeld/Myers): instead of asking "did
//! this prompt pass a filter?", ask "can this value, derived from these
//! sources, legally flow into this sink?".
//!
//! The moving parts:
//!
//! - Every turn in a [`turn::Trajectory`] carries a [`label::Label`] — a
//!   product of independent dimensions ([`dimension`]), each with its own
//!   combine algebra. Turns never walk alone: there is no API to append an
//!   unlabeled turn, and a tool result only enters by consuming the
//!   [`engine::Permit`] the policy minted for it.
//! - The context label is the fold of all turn labels
//!   ([`turn::Trajectory::context_label`]). Taint propagates through the fold,
//!   not through per-call bookkeeping.
//! - Tools declare a [`contract::ToolContract`]: [`contract::Requirements`]
//!   over the context label, plus an output label their results wear. The
//!   sink check is the design notes' `(Requirements − Label)`: an empty diff
//!   permits, a non-empty one escalates as typed [`contract::Violation`]s.
//! - An [`authority::Authority`] (human in the loop, judge model, webhook...)
//!   adjudicates escalations. An approval waives violations *for that flow
//!   only* and every waiver is recorded as an audited declassification; the
//!   context itself is never loosened.
//! - `Unknown` is a first-class value of audience, trust, and effects, and an
//!   unregistered tool is evaluable (all-`Unknown` output). What `Unknown`
//!   means at a sink is an explicit policy choice
//!   ([`engine::UnknownPolicy`]), so a deployment can annotate five
//!   high-risk tools, leave the rest unknown, and still catch the obvious
//!   flows — gradual typing for agent stacks.
//!
//! One deliberate deviation from the original notes: the audience fold is
//! **intersection** (most-restrictive readers), not union — see
//! [`dimension::Audience`] for why union would make the sink check vacuous.
