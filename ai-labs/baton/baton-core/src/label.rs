//! [`Label`]: the metadata that travels with every turn, and its combine.
//!
//! The crate has two distinct algebraic objects over the same dimensions;
//! keeping them apart is load-bearing:
//!
//! - **Taint fold** — how provenance *combines* as turns meet. Per data
//!   dimension this is a commutative, idempotent semilattice (see
//!   [`crate::dimension`]); `Unknown` has a definite position in each. The
//!   whole [`Label`] is **not** a join-semilattice: it is a monoid whose
//!   product is (that semilattice product over audience/trust/effects) × a
//!   non-commutative Writer log for `audit`. So the whole-label operation is
//!   [`Label::combine`] (monoid append), not a lattice join.
//! - **Adequacy relation** — the *proof* at a sink: is this context good
//!   enough for this flow? That is a three-valued decision, not a lattice
//!   comparison, and lives beside each dimension's combine
//!   ([`crate::dimension`]) and in [`crate::contract`].
